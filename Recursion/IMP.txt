Stack OverFlow:-
A recursive function calls itself endlessly without a proper base condition, leading to exhaustion of the call stack (the area in memory that stores function calls).

What is a Recursion Tree?
A recursion tree is a diagram that shows how a recursive algorithm breaks down a problem into subproblems.
